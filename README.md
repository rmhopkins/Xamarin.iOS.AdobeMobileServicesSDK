# Xamarin.iOS.AdobeMobileServicesSDK
=================
A Xamarin.iOS Binding for Adobe Mobile Services SDK

Every so often, I'm required to create a bindings library for a native Objective C/Java SDKs on iOS or Android for integration into a Xamarin C# mobile development project.  This is one such binding project.  It is provided as-is with no specific guarantees, however you may find it useful as a basis if you want to incorporate Adobe Mobile Services into your iPhone or iPad app.

There is no implied support or maintenance agreement that comes with this binding project.  It may not be updated over time as new versions of the SDK are released, although I may consider requests to update it in specific cases.
