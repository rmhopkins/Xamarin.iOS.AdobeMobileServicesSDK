=================
A Xamarin.iOS Binding for Adobe Mobile Services SDK

Occasionally I am required to create bindings for various Xamarin-related mobile development projects in order to integrate native Objective C/Java SDKs.  These are thrown up here as-is, and don't come with any implicit guarantees or support.  They may not be updated over time, so it is advisable to check the dates/versions where available to see how recent the release is.
